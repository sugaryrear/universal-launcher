# Universal Launcher
This launcher is meant to provide a simple and non-intrusive means of serving jars to clients that are frequently updated so that the client does not need to repeatedly download new files. The configuration is simple and located in `Config.java` for ease of use.



# Distribution
A Gradle task has been created to jar the necessary files for distribution.
The `fatJar` task will create a jar for you to distribute with all necessary dependencies.
